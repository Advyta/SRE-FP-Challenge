# Overview of EFK Stack

## 1. Introduction to EFK Stack
- **Elasticsearch**: A powerful search and analytics engine used for storing and searching log data.
- **Fluentd**: A data collector used for aggregating and forwarding logs to Elasticsearch.
- **Kibana**: A data visualization and exploration tool used for viewing and analyzing log data stored in Elasticsearch.

## 2. Setting Up EFK Components

### Deploying Fluentd
- Fluentd will be deployed as a **DaemonSet** to ensure that it runs on every node in the Kubernetes cluster. It will collect logs from all the pods running on the node.

### Deploying Elasticsearch
- Elasticsearch will be deployed as a **StatefulSet** in Kubernetes to ensure data persistence and scalability.

### Deploying Kibana
- Kibana will be deployed as a **Deployment** to visualize the logs stored in Elasticsearch.

## 3. Collecting Logs from Various Components

### Frontend Logs
- **Method**: Logs are sent to the backend or directly to Fluentd via HTTP endpoints.
- **Example**: Using an HTTP logging library in the frontend application.

### Backend Logs
- **Method**: Logs are written to stdout/stderr and collected by Fluentd from `/var/log/containers`.
- **Example**: Configure the applicationâ€™s logger to output logs to stdout.

### Database Logs
- **Method**: Fluentd tails database log files or reads logs from the database pod's stdout.
- **Example**: PostgreSQL logs to stdout, collected by Fluentd from `/var/log/containers`.

### Message Bus Logs
- **Method**: Logs from message bus services like Kafka are collected via Fluentd plugins or tailed from log files.
- **Example**: Kafka logs are written to log files, which Fluentd tails.

## 4. Conclusion
- In a Kubernetes environment, the EFK stack can efficiently aggregate logs from various components.
- By setting up Fluentd, Elasticsearch, and Kibana in Kubernetes, you can achieve a robust and scalable logging solution that centralizes logs from the frontend, backend, database, and message bus, providing comprehensive insights into the health and performance of your applications.
